#  Netflix Clone – Frontend UI Project

This is a **frontend-only clone** of the Netflix landing page, built using **HTML** and **CSS**. Developed as part of my personal project, the aim was to replicate the look and feel of Netflix’s user interface to sharpen our web design skills and demonstrate responsive layout techniques.
